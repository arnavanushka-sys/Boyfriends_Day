      <p class="message">
        I don’t really know what to say now that everything between us is over.
        I thought if nothing else, I’d at least give you this gift finished. At
        least we’ll be able to say we finished what we started — that we gave it
        our all. After so many chances, it’s for sure now that we were never
        actually meant to be together.<br>
        You’ve done things that deeply hurt me, things I never imagined I’d
        experience at the hands of someone I loved so much. And still, I don’t
        hate you. I don’t know how to. My love for you didn’t disappear just
        because the relationship broke. But that doesn’t mean I can stay,
        either.<br>
        So if there’s anything left in you that ever cared for me, please — don’t
        respond to my messages again. If not that don’t come back, not even if I
        cry, not even if I beg. Even if my heart aches so loudly it drowns out
        everything else, please don’t let us fall into the same cycle. Let this
        be the final act of love from you: walk away, and don’t look back.<br>
        I gave you everything I had. Every part of me yet I was not enough. But
        I’ve no regrets, I gave my 1000%. I was real. I know now I deserve better —
        not someone else, but a better version of myself. I deserve to take all
        that love I gave to you and finally give it back to me. I owe that to
        the girl who kept trying.<br>
        I’ll always carry the warmth of our good memories, even if they’re
        wrapped in sadness now. And I’ll carry the pain too — the kind that makes
        me question if I’ll ever feel enough again. You’ve left me with pieces of
        myself I don’t quite recognize anymore.<br>
        But still, thank you. For the love, for the lessons, and for showing me
        the parts of me that still need healing. I just wish goodbye didn’t have
        to hurt this much.
